# Occupancy-Dataset-Analysis
Analyzing occupancy dataset using J48 Decision Tree algorithm and K-Means clustering.

# Dataset Description
The “Occupancy Detection” dataset records the presence of occupants in a room, which is
determined from a set of time stamped pictures that were taken every minute from 14:19:00 on 02-
02-2015 to 09:17:59 on 02-18-2015. For each instance, it also stores the attributes such as
temperature, humidity, light and CO2 level in that room when the picture was clicked and whether
there was anyone present in the room. The instances were already divided into test and training
sets, we merged them into a single dataset and reassigned instances to create our own training,
testing and validation sets.
